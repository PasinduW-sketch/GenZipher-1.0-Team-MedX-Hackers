GenZipher 1.0 – Competitive Programming & CTF

This repository contains solutions, methodologies, and write-ups from our participation in GenZipher 1.0, a competition focused on problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and reverse engineering.

Rather than focusing only on final answers, our approach emphasized clear reasoning, structured methodologies, and reproducible solutions, closely reflecting real-world software engineering practices.
