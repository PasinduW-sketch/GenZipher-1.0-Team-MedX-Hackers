This repository contains **solutions, methodologies, and write-ups** from our participation in **GenZipher 1.0**, a competition focused on:

- Problem-solving  
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Reverse engineering  
- Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges  

Rather than focusing only on final answers, our approach emphasized:

- ✅ Clear reasoning  
- ✅ Structured methodologies  
- ✅ Reproducible solutions  

This closely reflects **real-world software engineering practices**.
